Observations based on data analysis of PyMoli game:

1. The percentage of male players, 84.03%, is significantly higher than that of the female palyers, 14.06%, but the female players have a slightly higher average purchase total over male players. 

2. The highest percentage of players is in the age 20-24 age group at 44.79%. Players over the age of 40 account for the lowest percentage of players. 

3. The average total purchase per player in the age group 20-24 is slightly lower than the 35-39 and the under 10 age group. However the sheer number of players in the 20-24 age group accounts for the highest toal purchase value.
